**Effective Date:** 2 April 2025

Welcome to Plavo! We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, protect, and share your information when you use our travel companion app (the “App”). By using the App, you consent to the practices outlined in this policy. Please take a moment to understand our approach to privacy.

## Our Privacy Principles

At Plavo, we adhere to these fundamental privacy principles:

- **Minimal Data:** We collect only the data necessary to provide the App’s services.
- **Transparency:** We’re open about how we handle your data.
- **Security:** We use industry-standard measures to protect your information.
- **User Control:** You have control over your data and preferences.
- **Continuous Improvement:** We regularly review and enhance our data protection practices.

## Information We Collect

- **Personal Information:** When you sign up, we collect personal information such as your name, email address, contact details, and account credentials necessary to create and maintain your account.
- **Travel Preferences:** To generate personalized itineraries, we collect information about your travel preferences, interests, budget, and historical travel data. This helps our AI curate customized travel plans tailored specifically to you.
- **Uploaded Content:** Our App allows you to upload photos, files, notes, and other materials related to your trips. We securely store this content to help you organize, track, and enhance your travel experiences.
- **Device and Usage Information:** We automatically collect technical information about your device, including IP address, device type, operating system, browser details, and usage patterns. This information helps us improve the App’s performance, security, and user experience.
- **Marketing Preferences & Consent:** We record your explicit consent when you opt in to marketing campaigns such as Plavo Pioneer.

We process your personal data on the basis of your consent, contractual necessity, or our legitimate interests, depending on the context and purpose of the data processing.

## How We Use Your Information

- **Personalization:** Your personal information, preferences, and uploaded content are used to create personalized itineraries, travel plans, recommendations, and customized app experiences.
- **Service Communications:** We may use your contact information to send you service-related notifications (e.g. password resets, booking confirmations).
- **Marketing Communications:** When you opt in (for example, by joining our Plavo Pioneer waitlist), we’ll send you occasional promotional emails, early access invitations, feature announcements, special offers, and Plavo Pioneer news. You can withdraw consent at any time by clicking “unsubscribe” in any email.
- **Service Improvement:** Your data helps us analyze user behavior, trends, and interactions to enhance functionality, usability, and performance.
- **Customer Support:** Information you provide helps us respond effectively to your customer service requests and support needs.
- **Security and Fraud Prevention:** We use your information to protect against fraud, unauthorized access, and other illegal activities.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell your personal data. However, we may share your information with:

- **Service Providers:** Trusted third-party vendors who provide essential services, such as data hosting, cloud storage, analytics, and customer support, under strict confidentiality agreements.
- **Legal Compliance:** If required by law, or to protect our rights, safety, and the safety of others, we may disclose your information in response to lawful requests by public authorities.
- **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your personal data may be transferred, provided the recipient maintains a comparable level of privacy protection.

## Data Security

We implement robust security measures, including encryption protocols, secure servers, and strict access controls to safeguard your personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

## Data Retention

We retain your personal data only as long as necessary to provide the services outlined in this Privacy Policy, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. You may request deletion of your data at any time, subject to any legal requirements we must fulfil.

## Third-Party Links

Our App may include links or integrations with third-party websites or services. We do not control these external entities' privacy practices and recommend reviewing their privacy policies independently.

## Children's Privacy

Our App is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information, contact us immediately for its removal.

## Your Rights and Choices

You have rights over your personal data, including:

- The right to access the personal data we hold about you.
- The right to rectify inaccurate or incomplete data.
- The right to request the deletion of your data.
- The right to restrict or object to how your data is used.
- The right to data portability, allowing you to obtain and reuse your personal data across different services.

You can manage your preferences within your account settings or contact us directly for assistance.

## International Data Transfers

Your personal data may be transferred to and processed in countries outside of your country of residence, including countries that may not have data protection laws equivalent to those in your jurisdiction. When we do so, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, such as Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission, to protect your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. All revisions will be effective upon posting, and we encourage you to review this policy regularly.
